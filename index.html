<a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h2>

<p>Ever since I got my first bite into coding, I immediately knew the path I wanted my future to take, and I could see it clearly. Up until my graduation during college, I began taking as many computer science courses as I could, with my interest in it growing with each one. After graduation, I found work in QA for mobile applications, getting a real feel for the work environment. But after working with developers and seeing their creations, I knew which side of the industry that called out to me. So just as anyone would do to satisfy their hunger, I fed myself, and began diving into Ruby, Rails, HTML and CSS, Javascript, and Backbone.js to name a few. The more I have to eat, the hungrier I get. </p>

<a name="about-you" class="anchor" href="#about-you"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About You</h2>

<p>You're here because you're not looking for someone trying to find a job, but for someone pursuing their passion. Someone who is a self-driven, independent learner, while being an effective communicator and collaborator. A person who has experience in the tech industry, and goes through withdrawal if not kept up to date on the latest news. You're looking for someone like yourself. </p>
