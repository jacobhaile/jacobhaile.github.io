Up until my graduation during college, I began taking as many computer science courses as I could, with my interest in it growing with each one. After graduation, I found work in QA for mobile applications, getting a real feel for the work environment. But after working with developers and seeing their creations, I knew which side of the industry that called out to me. So just as anyone would do to satisfy their hunger, I fed myself, and began diving into Ruby, Rails, HTML and CSS, Javascript, and Backbone.js to name a few. The more I have to eat, the hungrier I get. \r\n\r\n## About You\r\nYou're here because you're not looking for someone trying to find a job, but for someone pursuing their passion.
